-- SQL Script to Check Foreign Key Constraints on Schools Table
-- Run this to see all foreign key constraints that reference the schools table

SELECT
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
    rc.delete_rule

-- This will show you all tables that have foreign keys pointing to schools
-- and what happens on delete (CASCADE, RESTRICT, NO ACTION, etc.)
